                <p>I have done my schooling from St Xavier’s High school, Surat and Chittenango High school, New York, USA. I did my M.B.B.S. under Maharashtra University of Health Sciences at Terna Medical College, Mumbai. I have done my postgraduation - Master of Surgery in Ear, Nose & Throat Surgeries (M.S. ENT) from Mahatma Gandhi Mission’s Medical College, Mumbai. I went to Oxford University Hospital, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom as an Overseas International Visiting Fellow in June 2019 in the department of ENT, Head & Neck Surgeries. I have also gone as an International Observer to Michigan hospital, USA in 2019 at the department of ENT, Head & Neck Surgeries. Michigan Hospital’s ENT, Head & Neck department is considered one of the best in the World.
                    <br>ENT is a passion for me. My areas of interest are Nasal allergies, Endoscopic Sinus surgeries and General Otology. I try to treat most of my patients on OPD basis with minimal follow ups and hospital admissions. I prefer to prescribe minimal amount of antibiotics. I have been trained to treat all kinds of ENT problems by best of the Doctors and Surgeons. I have a keen interest in research and publications. I have been given the best presentation award by AOINMR Journal club for presenting a paper publication on foreign body in Airway. I have presented number of medical papers, medical posters and interesting patient cases at various ENT conferences.
                    <br>I would like to thank my parents, Advocate Shilpa Shah and Dr Vijay Shah for showering me with love and for their constant support. I would also like thank all my teachers, friends, relatives and colleagues for their care and support. I will always remember the Hippocratic Oath we have been sworn to, at the time of graduation. For me, my patients are next to God and I will do everything possible to give them the right treatment. </p>
